# COMP3134 - Introduction to Cyber Security<br> Assignment 2

## Objective
Exemplify passive sniffing techniques on both your droplet server and localhost machine

## Tasks:
**Steps 1 & 2 are done by listening to network traffic on a droplet server.Generate traffic if necessary.**

1. Capture 10 UDP packets on your droplet server
    - Display the:
        - Source Host
        - Source Port
        - Destination Host
        - Destination Port
    - Create a text file named **step_1.txt**
    - Write the command executed for the capture 
    - The output produced from the capture
    - The information requested for each packet
    - **NOTE** Please use the following format for the file
        - Commands: write the commands
        - Output: 10 lines of output
        - Details
        - Packet 1
        - Source Host: (value) Source Port: (value) Destination Host: (value), Destination Port (value) x10 times total

2. Capture 10 HTTP packets on your droplet server
    - Display
        - Source Host
        - Source Port

    - in a text file named **step_2.txt**
    - Write the command executed for the capture
    - The output produced from the capture
    - The information requested for each packet
    - Please use the following format for the file
        - Command: written command
        - Output: 10 lines of output
        - Details:
        - Packet 1
        - Source Host: (value) Source Port: (value) Destination Host: (value), Destination Port (value) x10 times total

**The following steps are to be done on a local host machine.**

3. Capture any 10 packets in which your computer is communicating with another network. Highlight/state the **source host, source port, destination host, and destination port**. Take screenshots and use paint or any other image-processingg application to highlight the requested information
