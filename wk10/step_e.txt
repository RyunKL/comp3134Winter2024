In this code:

We define the HTML directory path ($html_directory). You should adjust this path to match the location of your HTML directory on your server.
We check if the provided path is not empty. If it's not empty, we resolve the absolute path using realpath() and prepend the HTML directory path.
We check if the resolved absolute path is within the HTML directory. If it's not within the HTML directory, we default the path to the HTML directory.
Finally, we print the directory listing using scandir(), providing the full path.
