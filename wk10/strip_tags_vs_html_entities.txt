1.) strip_tags() is used to remove all HTML and PHP tags from a string. It strips away potential HTML or PHP code that could be executed on the web page, leaving only the plain text.

2.) htmlspecialchars() converts special characters to HTML entities. This allows the characters to be displayed on the page without being interpreted as part of the HTML markup.
